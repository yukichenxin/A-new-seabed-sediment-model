YOLO-C
YOLO-C has the capability to accurately identify and classify different types of seabed sediments, enabling more effective resource assessment and extraction planning. Additionally, in environmental monitoring and conservation efforts, YOLO-C's precise boundary detection and segmentation allow for the precise mapping of sensitive marine habitats and the detection of any changes or disturbances. Moreover, in underwater archaeological surveys, YOLO-C's ability to capture detailed sediment characteristics enhances the identification and preservation of submerged cultural heritage sites. These examples demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of our proposed model in key application domains.
Due to this program is still processing, the code continues uploading...
This is the result of seabed sediment which use YOLO-C
